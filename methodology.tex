\chapter{Proposed methodology}

How are we actually going to solve the problem.
What is the proposed approach?
Here we talk about what we are going to use.
Still not clear what are the actual contributions of the proposal.

\section{Part detection}

How are we going to detect the parts.
Heuristics to detect were the liquid is?
The slippage thing, with manual input when needed.
I.e. to specify pump input or to say where the liquid is.

\section{Fluid simulation}

Using SPH, Grid or Hybrid simulation.
Looks like grid since we are constrained to a small area and we do care about foams or other extra realism stuff.

\section{Flow visualization}

We are going to use stream lines on surfaces and then replace them by arrows.

\section{Fixed parts visualization}

Rip off gears papers

\section{Animation}

Simulation data is already the animation

\section{Key frames visualization}

sample the animation
For uniform translation only one in between, sample the animation at critical points

\section{Time line}

Table with a time line, diagram?
