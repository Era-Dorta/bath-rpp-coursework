\chapter{Proposed methodology}

How are we actually going to solve the problem.
What is the proposed approach?
Here we talk about what we are going to use.

\section{Part detection}

How are we going to detect the parts.
Heuristics to detect were the liquid is?
All manual? The slippage thing.

\section{Fluid simulation}

Using SPH, Grid or Hybrid simulation.
Looks like grid since we are constrained to a small area and we do care about foams or other extra realism stuff.

\section{Flow visualization}

We are going to use stream lines on surfaces and then replace them by arrows.


\section{Fixed parts visualization}

Rip off gears papers?

\section{Final visualization}
What about the animation part???

\section{Time line}

Table with a time line, diagram?
