\chapter{Evaluation}

The system will be tested by generating illustrations for a wide variety of models.
Since we do not know of any previous work which has generated \textit{How things work} illustrations for hydraulic machinery, comparison with other methods is limited to contrast our work against manually generated illustrations.
Another path to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated data is to perform a user study, where the test subjects are evaluated on how well they understood the machinery internal workings.
Moreover, user studies can be helpful in fine tuning parameters in the outputted data, therefore improving the quality of the results.
Comparing frame sequences, animations and single illustrations is another interesting evaluation study.

%we plan to test it on a variety of models, other way is comparison with previous work, user study -> like doing and study of how well they understood how the machinery works, â€¦ try think about more ideas to test the approach, comparison of frame sequence, animation and arrows, which one does the user think is more useful symmetry information
