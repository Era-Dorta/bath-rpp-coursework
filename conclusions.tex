\chapter{Applications and Conclusions}

We are proposing a tool whose main aim are educational purposes.
Therefore, the most obvious applications would be to generate \textit{How things work} visualizations for museums, schools and educational centres in general.
Such institutions would benefit from having a semi-automatic illustration generator.
Since by its automatic nature, it will address the issues with depictions created manually by experts that were discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:intro}, such as a time consuming generation stage or lack of actualization when new machinery arrives, .

We have presented a proposal for a semi-automatic \textit{How things work} illustrations generator for hydraulic machinery.
The system would work with 3D CAD models of hydraulic assemblies and it would output the illustrations, either single frame or key frames.
The work flow of the algorithm includes a segmentation stage, were the 3D model is divided into parts with restricted degrees of freedom, a fluid simulation stage were the hydraulic interactions are calculated, and finally a visualization stage were techniques from flow visualization and illustrating motion in single images are used to depict the overall internal workings of the hydraulic machinery.
